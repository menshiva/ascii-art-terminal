## How to Use üìÉ

#### Basics

1) [Build and run](#build-) the application
2) Choose _Add image(s)_ section to add image
3) Enter absolute path to image you want to add or simply drag your image into terminal - this action will paste path to image
4) Press Enter and wait for image to convert
5) You can add more images if you want or enter the "q" symbol to cancel
6) To display your image as ASCII Art, choose _Show ASCII art_ section
7) Choose image you want to show by entering it's index in loaded path's list
8) **Enjoy** your ASCII art!

#### Image properties

* To apply effects to your image:
    1) Choose image in _Show ASCII art_ section
    2) Choose _Image effects_ section
    3) Enter index of effect you want to add or to remove if its already applied or enter the "q" symbol to cancel
    4) Press Enter to save changes
* To remove image from list:
    1) Choose _Remove image_ section
    2) Choose image you want to remove by entering it's index in loaded path's list
* To export image to _.txt_ file:
    1) Choose image in _Show ASCII art_ section
    2) Choose _Export art_ section
    3) Enter absolute path to .txt file you want to create
    4) Press Enter to save changes

#### Animation

* To enable this function you need to add **at least 2 images**
* Animation controls:
    1) Choose _Play animation_ section to start animation
    2) Choose _Pause animation_ section to stop animation

Note: Images will display in order they were loaded

#### Optional utils

* **Style ASCII art** with your own symbols in _Set grayscale level_ section:
    - You need to enter the sequence of symbols from darkest to lightest
    - Your ASCII art will be shown by these symbols
